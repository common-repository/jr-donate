== Description ==

This PayPal Donate plugin displays a donate widget on your blog, which allows users to donate to you via PayPal.



The plugin can use javascript to display the donation form, enabled through the admin panel. Users can click a donation link, to show a form to enable users to enter their desired donation amount. They will then be transferred to PayPal to complete the transaction.

You can set the correct currency, which users are required to donate in. This means that you'll receive the currency that you want.



New in version 1.2.0 is the ability to show a message to the people who have just donated to you!

 It's very easy to setup the plugin - Simply enable it, alter the settings and then enable the widget!
